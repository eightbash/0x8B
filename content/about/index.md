# About Me

I'm eightB, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for open source tools and ethical hacking. I love having complete control over my systems and the freedom to customize everything according to my needs.

My focus lies primarily in CTF competitions, which I consider the best way to learn new techniques and sharpen existing skills. I'm currently working towards my OSCP certification while deepening my knowledge in penetration testing and vulnerability research.

In my professional work, I deploy and manage enterprise solutions using open source technologies. This includes setting up Samba for file sharing and domain controllers, hardening Linux infrastructure, implementing Nextcloud for secure cloud storage, managing Bitwarden password systems, deploying Paperless for document management, and creating security solutions with monitoring capabilities.

What drives me towards open source solutions is the transparency they provide, the full control over my systems, the community-driven development approach, and the freedom to modify and adapt tools to specific requirements. CTFs remain my favorite learning method as each challenge teaches something new about web exploitation, binary analysis, cryptography, network security, and forensics.

My current goals include obtaining the OSCP certification, participating in more CTF competitions, working on advanced enterprise deployments, and continuing to learn while sharing knowledge with the community.
